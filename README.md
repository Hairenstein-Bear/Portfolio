# Portfolio
My Web Portfolio
Code for my personal portfolio site.  I assembled this site on the theme of working in a "virtual office" the lights are functional and I tried to incorporate
interactivity where I could without it feeling too cluttered.  It is coded in VsCode and utilizes HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.  I incorporated some of my other projects
into this one like the clock on the landing page.
