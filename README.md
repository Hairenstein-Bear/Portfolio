# Portfolio
My Web Portfolio
My objective with this portfolio was to really solidify my knowledge of how the code interacted and use little to no frameworks so that I could improve my ability to create custom components and frameworks without feeling constrained to what someone else has already created.


Code for my personal portfolio site.  I assembled this site on the theme of working in a "virtual office" the lights are functional and I tried to incorporate
interactivity where I could without it feeling too cluttered.  It is coded in VsCode and utilizes HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.  I incorporated some of my other projects into this one like the clock on the landing page.
