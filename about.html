                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Paul Hair, and I am a software developer based out of Tampa, Florida.  I have an Associates of Science from the State College of Florida where I majored in Computer Programming and Analysis.</p><br><p>My courses focused on software development and used project application to educated students.  In pursuit of my diploma I learned: Python, HTML, CSS, C++, PHP, and SQL.  I applied these languages in projects using: VsCode, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, and Visual Studio.  In my personal time I have expanded my knowledge beyond what I learned in college.  During this time I have taught myself: Javascript, Node.JS, Bootstrap, and Jquery.</p><br><p>I am married, with two dogs(Percy and Leia), and a cat(Smokey).  I am an avid fan of tabletop gaming, some of my favorite games include:<br> Ticket to Ride, Wingspan, and Dungeons & Dragons.  I have ran a homebrew Dungeons and dragons game for a little over 5 years, and played with some amazing Game Masters as well.</p><br><p>  One of the aspects of tabletop gaming that I always love is the planning and strategy elements, each game feels like a puzzle waiting to be solved.  I think this is what initially drew me to software development, each application is an exciting new puzzle to solve.</p><br><p>When I'm not inside programming, or gaming I like to visit state parks.  The calm of nature always helps me collect my thoughts and jump back into my task with renewed vigor.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.</p>
